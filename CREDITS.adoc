This project is a fork of the official 
https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoModbus[ArduinoModbus] library 
by the Arduino team.

== Original Work
- Arduino Libraries Team  
- Repository: https://github.com/arduino-libraries/ArduinoModbus  

== Modifications
- Adapted for Arduino Due RS485 with DMA support.  
- Integration with https://github.com/NitrofMtl/DUERS485DMA[DUERS485DMA].  
- Maintainer: @NitrofMtl  

== Notes
- This fork maintains compatibility with the official ArduinoModbus API, 
  but requires explicit instantiation of `ModbusRTUServerClass` and `ModbusRTUClientClass`.
- Issues and pull requests for this fork should be submitted to:  
  https://github.com/NitrofMtl/ArduinoModbus-DUE-DMA
